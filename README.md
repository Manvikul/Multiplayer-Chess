# Multiplayer-Chess

Our aim is to make a multiplayer chess engine with the better efficiency.

Sub-objectives of the project are : 
* Designing the 8 * 8 chess board.
* Setting up the pieces with their names.
* Putting algorithms for implementing the basic as well as the special rules of chess.
* Keeping the count of every move.
* Declaring the winner of the game or displaying “DRAW” if the game gets draw due to some condition.

## Abstract

In this project we aim to implement the standard chess game using C, a basic and a broadly used language, supporting structured programming. The chessboard will be 2D and will have a grid size of 8 * 8. The chessboard and the pieces are going to be the essential elements of the project, on which further, we will be implementing the logic of the game. Without these two parts, all the functionalities cannot be achieved as the board must restrict the movement of pieces at any time, and the game cannot run without the pieces. [1]

The game provides human to human capability for both playing and learning, in which they need to be present in the same geographical location physically. It is a offline game which asks the user to choose their set of color for further playing and thus helps in deciding who wants the make the first move.

## Aim

![Methodology](img/Methodology.png)

This project focuses on implementing **Layer 2 i.e. Data-Link Layer** of TCP/IP Stack. The project mainly focuses on Graph Data Structures highlighting the features of Generic Graph Topology. The project will use routers, switches, links as well as nodes to depict the overall functionality of network topology, the entire packet journey (on sending and receiving machines) through the Data Link Layer of TCP/IP Model along with a minimal use of Socket Programming will be shown in this project.
