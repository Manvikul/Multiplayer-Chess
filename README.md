# Multiplayer-Chess

Our Aim is to make a multiplayer chess engine with the better efficiency.

Sub-objectives of the project are : 
* Designing the 8 * 8 chess board.
* Setting up the pieces with their names.
* Putting algorithms for implementing the basic as well as the special rules of chess.
* Keeping the count of every move.
* Declaring the winner of the game or displaying “DRAW” if the game gets draw due to some condition.

## Abstract

In this project we aim to implement the standard chess game using C, a basic and a broadly used language, supporting structured programming. The chessboard will be 2D and will have a grid size of 8 * 8. The chessboard and the pieces are going to be the essential elements of the project, on which further, we will be implementing the logic of the game. Without these two parts, all the functionalities cannot be achieved as the board must restrict the movement of pieces at any time, and the game cannot run without the pieces. [1]

The game provides human to human capability for both playing and learning, in which they need to be present in the same geographical location physically. It is a offline game which asks the user to choose their set of color for further playing and thus helps in deciding who wants the make the first move. 

***Keyword :*** *chessboard and pieces, human to human capability.*

## Introduction

In the last five years the strength of computer chess programs has grown immensely. They have a place with easygoing games, and it requires two players to continue on a chessboard of size 8 * 8. The guidelines of this game are straightforward yet have boundless ways to move pieces, thus each step is urgent to the player. 

Initially we are working with 2 player game. Later we will step up with multiplayers with similar algorithm. This program for chess will be the most efficient one till now in C language. The program supports a reasonable number of functions and the game will be in 2D. This game will be played in same system by the two different players.
